# Welcome to My Blog!

This is my first post! Here I will introduce myself and the webpage in a casual way.

First of all, introductions. I am Miguel Vázquez and I do things with mathematics, computers and artificial intelligence. I studied mathematics in Seville, Spain, the same extremely beautiful city I was born in. In my third year of university I started to get interested in artificial intelligence and I did what everyone did at that time: Andrew Ng's Coursera machine learning course. Since then I have been doing a lot of data science and machine learning and I just love it. While I studied for my master's degree I managed to get a job as a data scientist intern at oga.ai. Almost two years later I am still working there as a data scientist.

This is my personal blog, and I will try to post about these topics, showcase different projects I develop, discuss ideas that are of my interest and I might even get some people to read what I write.

## Why?

I say that I will *try to post* because I don't usually write anything that is not for academics or my job, which surprises me since I have always loved to read anything I can get my hands on. So why am I starting a blog? Actually several things have come together for me to take this decision. Let's talk about them.

First of all, it is true that I don't write much. *Yet*. I've always wanted to get into the habit of writing: I love literature and I read writings from many people I admire in all kinds of topics, but I never found what to write about. I tried several times to write about my thoughts, a personal diary, and even to write music lyrics - even though I am, by far, the least talented musician I know - but it just did not stick. I've always been uncomfortable writing about myself and I could not find anything I could write about that was going to interest people. But I think that I might have some interesting things to write about now, and I will have more as time goes on. At the beginning my writings are going to be really bad, but I will improve. I’ll probably review this post someday and cringe, but oh well. So first reason of this blog is that *I want to write* and now I have *something to write about*.

I also want my webpage to look better. I built this website to learn how to do web development, to develop my personal image and to have a landing page for job applications. But once I finished the landing page I didn't know what else to do, and I wanted to develop it more. A blog looked like a great idea. I can write posts about projects I develop, which is good for SEO and for recruiters, and I get an excuse to start writing as I always wanted to.

Most importantly, I am convinced that contributing to the general discourse and making your voice heard is a positive force for society and can help in the progress of humanity. As I said I feel uncomfortable writing about my thoughts, and the real reason I am trying to do it is because I believe I have something to say. Of course, if I just write this blog no one will read this. For this reason I want to start using X (twitter), and maybe discord, to join the community. Not now, I don't currently have the time to start that many things at once, but when I get a few posts in here I will slow down with the projects and the blog and start with that.

## What?

So what is this blog going to be about? You can probably get an idea already. At the beginning I will post about different engineering projects I develop. I will also write about more general topics that I am working on from time to time. For example, at the time of writing, I am working on LLM agents and a ray tracing engine using pyTorch. In the following weeks I will write about those.

I am hoping that after having written a few posts this will become easier. I want to occasionally write about different topics that, while not my specialty, are really interesting to me. This can be pretty much anything: business, economy, philosophy, statistics, effective accelerationism, mathematics, or whatever matter I am thinking about at the time. At the moment of writing, I am starting to run as a way of training endurance, so I may write about it in a few months if I keep doing it (I usually do strength training, especially calisthenics, I am just trying running).

This blog will also work to showcase that I can build cool things, and to a lesser extent as some kind of professional portfolio, but I don't want to focus it on my professional career, for that I already have the landing page.

## Wrapping Up

Phew! Writing this was harder than I expected - I'll definitely need to get used to it. This or the following week, I'll be diving into a post about the ray tracing engine I'm building, which I'm excited to share. I'll also be adding a comment section to the blog so anyone who wants to engage can join the conversation. If you'd like to reach out directly, my email is listed at the bottom of the site.

I'm not planning to publicize this blog any time soon, so I am not expecting any type of engagement. But who knows? Maybe this blog will become a lasting project. Here's to the start of something new - thanks for reading!
